# Physics194ChallengeProblem
This code is meant to simulate the current through an LED in 4 scenarios: 
1.) when the LED is in series with the DC motor and the DC motor is spinning as normal,
2.) when the LED is in series with the DC motor and the DC motor is held so it can't spin,
3.) when the LED is parallel to the DC motor and the DC motor is spinning as normal,
4.) when the LED is parallel to the DC motor and the DC motor is held so it can't spin.
This code was written for WashU's Physics 194 Focused Physics 2 Course.
